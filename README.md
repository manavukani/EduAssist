# EduAssist

Ask questions about your lecture in real time, chat with your lecture!

## Motivation

As a university student, it can be frustrating to disrupt a lecture just to ask a question, especially when it risks derailing the class or causing embarrassment if the question isnâ€™t well-received. This project was created to address that issue. It enables students to inquire about the lecture content in real-time without causing interruptions. Additionally, it offers a live transcript of the lecture, ensuring that nothing is missed. The tool can also be leveraged later to generate notes and study materials.

## Key Features

- Ask questions during lectures in real-time
- Resolve doubts without disrupting anyone
- Access a live transcript of the lecture

### Disclaimer

This is just for learning purpose, please don't refrain from asking doubts to your professor. They would love to solve them and teach you.
