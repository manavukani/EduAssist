# EduAssist

**Real-time Q&A and Lecture Engagement**

My motivation was that students often misses key points during lectures, leading to confusion and missed opportunities. Asking questions in class can feel intimidating for shy pupils or disruptive. EduAssist solves this by offering:

* Real-time Q&A to  discreetly ask questions about lecture content without interrupting the flow.
* Live Transcript helps capture all information and ensure nothing is missed.
* The tool can also be leveraged later to generate notes and study materials.

**Disclaimer**

EduAssist is designed to supplement, not replace, direct interaction with your professor. Open communication with your instructor is crucial for optimal learning.
